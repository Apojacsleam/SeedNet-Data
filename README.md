# Introduction to data repository

This Github Repository stores data to accompany the paper "Statistical properties of the international seed trade networks of rice and maize". All figures, tables and conclusions in the paper are based on the data stored in this Github repository.

## Requirements

To use the data provided in this Github repository, you will need the following Python packages, and we give the version of each package used to generate the paper data.

```
Numpy(1.21.5)
Networkx(2.7.1)
```
You can install these packages with pip via
```
pip install numpy
pip install networkx
```
The figures in the paper are generated by the Python package Matplotlib, you can install Matplotlib with pip via
```
pip install matplotlib
```
## Data Source

The original data of the international trade networks of maize seeds and rice seeds analyzed in this paper are extracted from the UN Comtrade database (available at https://comtrade.un.org/, accessed on 22 September 2022). These two seeds are in the chapter of Cereals. The maize seeds are under Heading 1005 with HS code 100510, while the rice seeds are under Heading 1006 with HS code 100610. Since the data sets for year 2019 are incomplete, we take the data of maize seed and rice seed from 1990 to 2018 in Comtrade database for analysis in this work.

## Data Pre-processing

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

npz_file = np.load('./Data/iSTNs_Years_ComCodes.npz')
Years, Hscodes, NotEconomy = npz_file['Years'], npz_file['Hscodes'], npz_file['NotEconomy']


# Hs code of maize seed: 100510, Hs code of rice seed: 100610
def GetGraph(Hscode, years):
    Graph = nx.read_gpickle(f'./Data/iSeedTradeNetwork_{Hscode}_{year}.gpickle')
    GraphNodes = Graph.nodes()
    RemoveNodes = []
    # Remove non-economy nodes
    for NonEcon in NotEconomy:
        if NonEcon in GraphNodes:
            RemoveNodes.append(NonEcon)
    # Remove invalid nodes without trade links
    for Gnode in GraphNodes:
        if nx.degree(Graph, nbunch=Gnode) == 0:
            RemoveNodes.append(Gnode)
    for Gnode in RemoveNodes:
        Graph.remove_node(Gnode)
    return Graph
```
